Requires Python 3 to run.

Currently supports rendering an existing level and pathfinding from a starting point in the level.
To run:
```
python3 view.py <level-file>
```
Some sample level files are in the `levels/` directory.
Click anywhere in the level to navigate to the closest node in the navigation graph and display the path.
